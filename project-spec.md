Semantic Code means code that is easy to draw logical meaning from.
This is particularly important with HTML, as Screen Readers use Semantic HTML tags to navigate and draw meaning from a web page for visually impaired users.
Search engine web crawlers also use HTML tags to get information from your page (for example the information in a pages <title> tags) to rank web pages in 
search results.
Using Semantic HTML makes web pages more accessible
 

For this task, you will be given a set of User Specifications/Business Requirements.
ðŸ‘‰ Your job is to build an HTML page following these user specifications/business requirements using Semantic HTML only. The specifications are deliberately 
vague - itâ€™s your job to identify which HTML elements would be the most appropriate to use!
ðŸ‘‰ The submission we are looking for is just an .html file in a GitHub repository
This task is about Semantic HTML only. You do NOT need to use any CSS.
You donâ€™t need to make the whole page function! Itâ€™s okay if the nav bars donâ€™t work, and you donâ€™t have to setup a HTTP server to serve the HTML or handle 
navigations or anything like that.
 
ðŸ’¡ If you want to use this assignment as an excuse to setup a very simple development HTTP server and have your HTML pages navigate to each other correctly, 
then have fun! But it is NOT required.
 
Correct usage of Semantic HTML - can you justify your choice of HTML tags and attributes? Are you using semantic/appropriate elements e.g. instead of wrapping 
everything in lots of divs, could there be a better element to use like a <section> or <article> tag?
Have you tested your code in any way (e.g. the W3C MarkUp Validator https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and/or Google Chromes Lighthouse)? 
Could you navigate your page without using a mouse?
Have you used alt tags? What description have you chosen to use (if any at all) and why?
 
Submit a link to your News Article HTML GitHub repository to Google Classroom
The page must have the following elements (in no particular order or the order of your choice): 
1. As a user I would like to see the newspaper name that links back to the homepage: 
Tech Returner News 
2. As a user I would like to see a Navbar on the page that I can easily navigate to different pages with such as: 
News, Opinion, Tech, Sport, Culture, About, Lifestyle, Jobs 
3. As a user I would like to see a text box that offers me accessibility options so I can choose how I interact with the page: Preferences 
We aim to make this site accessible to a wide audience and to ensure a great experience for all users by conforming to World Wide Web Consortium

4. As a user I would like to see the name of the article so I can easily understand what the page is about: Accessibility Features: Easy Wins 
5. As a user I would like to see a sub-header with more information about the article: 
Handy tips on how to create accessible websites for everyone 
6. As a user I would like to see author information: 
Jim Eggs (link that opens up an email to jimmy.eggs@hotmail.com) 
04.08.21 
7. As a user I would like to see an image that adds colour and interest to the page - see accessibility.jpg
8. As a user I would like to see text article text broken up so I can navigate to different sections on the page and easily know what which section is about: 
Introduction 
9. As a user I would like to read the part of the article associated with the Introduction: 
Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and accessible to everyone. 
Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers and users). 
This often comes down to a lack of understanding around different user needs. 
Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldnâ€™t be too difficult.
 The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an â€˜easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility. 
Keep this guide handyâ€¦ When creating your own websites you can check these criteria off the list! 
10. As a user I would like to see links to other news articles thematically relating to the article I am currently on: 
What would a truly accessible city look like? Read more.. 
11. As a user I would like to see another sub-heading that I can easily navigate to that indicates what the next section of text is about: 
Accessibility Checks: 
12. As a user I would like to see text relating to the above header:
Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies 
that allow page navigation from heading to heading. 
Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom, 
page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page. 
Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate alternative text. 
Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from normal body text. 
If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been labelled as doing so. 
JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation or functionality, 
an alternative mechanism has been put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts. 
Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient 
and I have also ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone. 
Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off, information on the site can still be accessed and read. 
Forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. 
The form labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes. 
13. As a user I would like to see a link with more information so I can read more about the subject matter if interested: 
For more information on Web Accessibility view: Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility 
14. As a user I would like to see another sub-heading that I can easily navigate to that indicates what the next section of text is about: 
Conclusion 
15. As a user I would like to see text relating to the above header: 
By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for everyone. 
16. As a user I would like to see another sub-heading that I can easily navigate to that indicates what the next section of text is about:
